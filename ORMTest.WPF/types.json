Planets with existing, stable ecosystems are prime targets for colonization efforts as they are generally easier to make fully habitable; as a result, the majority of highly populated worlds are of this type.

The exact process for this varies from case to case, but the end result is both common and visually uniform - a bright, reflective planet scored by countless fractures and crevasses. A few icy planets are hypothesized to have been warmer, liquid-bearing planets in the past that have subsequently frozen, as a result of either stellar cooling or failed terraforming projects.","Mass":1E+35,"Volume":1.0,"Capacity":0.0,"PortionSize":1,"RaceID":null,"BasePrice":null,"Published":0,"MarketGroupID":null,"IconID":10137,"SoundID":20087,"GraphicID":3834},{"TypeID":13,"GroupID":7,"TypeName":"Planet (Gas)","Description":"Gas planets are characterized by a deep, opaque upper atmosphere, usually composed primarily of light elements such as hydrogen or helium. Simple chemicals can add a range of hues and shades in the visual spectrum, and the interaction between upwellings and rapidly circulating pressure bands result in a huge variety of visible surface structures. A similar level of diversity can be found beneath the cloud-tops: the inner composition of a given gas planet might belong to any one of a dozen broad groups, with no two planets entirely alike in this regard.","Mass":1E+35,"Volume":1.0,"Capacity":0.0,"PortionSize":1,"RaceID":null,"BasePrice":null,"Published":0,"MarketGroupID":null,"IconID":10139,"SoundID":20086,"GraphicID":3833},{"TypeID":14,"GroupID":8,"TypeName":"Moon","Description":"","Mass":1E+35,"Volume":1.0,"Capacity":0.0,"PortionSize":1,"RaceID":null,"BasePrice":null,"Published":0,"MarketGroupID":null,"IconID":10141,"SoundID":null,"GraphicID":10},{"TypeID":15,"GroupID":9,"TypeName":"Asteroid Belt","Description":"","Mass":1E+35,"Volume":1.0,"Capacity":0.0,"PortionSize":1,"RaceID":null,"BasePrice":null,"Published":0,"MarketGroupID":null,"IconID":15,"SoundID":9,"GraphicID":0},{"TypeID":16,"GroupID":10,"TypeName":"Stargate (Caldari System)","Description":"","Mass":100000000000.0,"Volume":10000000.0,"Capacity":0.0,"PortionSize":1,"RaceID":1,"BasePrice":null,"Published":0,"MarketGroupID":null,"IconID":null,"SoundID":32,"GraphicID":235}]
